				“Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life. Therein he cannot be replaced nor can his life be repeated. Thus everyone’s task is unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.”<br><br>
-- Victor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning<br><br>

What stops one from achieving this meaning in life is’ ‘physical disease’ and ‘mindsets’ that sees obstacles where there is opportunity. 
<br><br>
In 1796 year samuel hahnemann discovered the principle of similia similibus curentur, that is, a substance that has the capacity to produce a disease like ‘state’ in a healthy person (provings) can cure that similar disease ‘state’ in a patient. Thus was born homeopathy. The goal of homoeopathy is to remove all obstacles “so that our indwelling, reason-gifted mind can freely employ this living, healthy instrument for the higher purpose of our existence.” <br><br>
-- Samuel Hahnemann, Aphorism 9, Organon of Medicine. 

What do we mean here, by the ‘state’, and the ‘disease’<br><br>
Functional change precedes structural changes. Hence the ‘state’ precedes the named physical diseases, for example arthritis, hypothyroidism, and cancer.<br><br>

The ‘state’ is unconscious i.e beyond the conscious mind, and body and yet controls it like a master puppeteer pulling strings and creating repeated unhealthy patterns in life that ultimately get fixed in the cells of the organ as a named disease (eg.arthritis,asthma etc.).The homeopath’s sole purpose is to match the pattern(symptoms) of this unconscious state in the patient, to the pattern (symptoms) produced by the homeopathic remedy in the healthy person(prover).<br><br>

The homeopathic remedies are used in a specific diluted form (potencies) to enhance their medicinal effects. While microscopic proof and explanation of how this ‘matched remedy’ works is work in progress, the demonstrated effects have lead to a reasonable postulation that the remedy acts on the PNEI (psycho neuro endocrine immunology) axis.<br><br>

What then are these symptoms?<br>
“All our knowledge begins with the senses(5 senses), proceeds then to the understanding”<br><br>
                                                                                                              - Immanuel Kant, <br><br>
The very first signals of the ‘disease’ given by our body to us, are those that we perceive through our 5 senses.Dr.Divya’s  method of reaching the remedy to cure the disease, the ‘leap to similimum’, is the method of eliciting the symptoms of the disease, in the realm of the 5 senses, and tracing their path upto the master puppeteer -- ‘the disease state in the unconscious’.<br><br> 

Metaphorically, perhaps it's like the remedy acts as a ‘mirroring’ of the disease state at an unconscious level, removing this state and hence the resulting disease in the organs, allowing the person to be free to reach his fullest potential. <br><br>
                               
                             …..Then in that moment you will be free
