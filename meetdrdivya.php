Born in Pune in 1967 , she was introduced to homeopathy at the age of 7 months.In the throes of severe intractable colic the paediatrician suspected volvulus and said if so, surgery may be called for. Her mother in calm desperation opened up Dr Bishambar Das (a family friend) book and bought the first 3 remedies that matched the symptoms of colic. The second was the bulls eye simillimum and the colic was history.<br> <br> 
Perhaps from there was born not only the passion for homeopathy but the unwavering quest for the ‘bull’s eye’ simillimum (the perfect constitutional homeopathic remedy for the patient).<br>  <br> 

After graduating as a Gold Medallist from CMP homoeopathic medical college , she did her MD from DKMM Homoeopathic Medical College. She did her residency at Mumbadevi hospital  and at Bhatia hospital where she gained ICU experience as well.<br> <br>  

Diagnosis is a mathematical skill on the landscape of experiential instinct. The honing of this skill both for disease diagnosis and homeopathic remedy diagnosis, she owes to her brilliant mentors , Dr Rajan Sankaran (Homeopathy), Dr Sanjeev Khanna (Internal Medicine), Dr Nitin Sampat (Neurology), Dr Dushyant Punwani (Paediatrics) and Dr.Devadiga (Homeopathy) and Dr.Paidunghat (Internal Medicine).
<br> <br> 
To fully understand the scope and application of the homeopathic remedy she has researched 10 new homeopathic remedies which are being used all over the world today. <br><br>  

Her evolving methodology in the quest for perfection has one constant, the exploration of the unconscious as a controller of disease patterns.<br><br>   

The pinnacle of her work is the “Leap to the simillimum” method she practises today.<br> <br>  

Her unwavering dedication to her patients is matched by her zeal for teaching all that she knows to the practitioners and students of homeopathy. To this end she has since the last 26 years been teaching homeopathy in India and around the world, like Boston, New York , Toronto, Moscow, Berlin, Australia, Finland, Spain etc.<br><br>  

Her wit, warmth and calm even in chaos, is what we learn from and imbibe in the clinic. <br><br>  
And yet, one day she will walk in with a frown and start rearranging the room, straightening papers and we know  “ Oh Oh she needs her homeopathic remedy today!”  But who will bell the cat we wonder, as we laugh over it together the next day at one of our shared lunches. 
<br> <br> 
Her quest for perfection while highly beneficial for her patients has led to an interminable delay in the writing of her books, despite repeated sarcastic rejoinders by her two sons Soham (21) and Sahaj (17). But we never say never...
<br> <br> 
A tea addict, a classical dancer , an avid reader, a tennis afficcando , her constant rejoinder to her coach is “how far is Wimbledon now!”
