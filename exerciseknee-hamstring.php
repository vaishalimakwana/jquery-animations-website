<strong>Purpose:</strong> Excellent knee strengthening exercise for the hamstrings, quads and buttock muscles.<br><br> 
<strong>Starting Position:</strong> Lie on your back with both knees bent about 90° and your feet on the floor/bed.<br><br> 
<strong>Action:</strong> Clench your buttocks and lift your bottom off the bed as high as you can without arching your back. The back appears like a bridge between your upper and lower body. Hold for 3-5 seconds and slowly lower to starting position.<br><br>
