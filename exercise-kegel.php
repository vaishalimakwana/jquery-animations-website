Kegel exercise is helpful for treating stress incontinence, urinary incontinence, prostate problems and to improve retention of urine. 
<br><br>
<strong>Step 1: Find the right muscles</strong><br>
	<ul class="bullets">
		<li>While passing urine, stop the urine midstream. </li>
<li>During the exercise, you will need to contract all the muscles which you are using right now to stop the urine flow.</li>

</ul>	

	
<strong>Step 2: The technique</strong>
	<ul class="bullets">
<li>This can be done any time of the day, while sitting at work or in a vehicle, while lying down, etc. Tighten the muscles that you contracted in step 1, and hold the contraction for 5 seconds. Next, relax them for 5 seconds. Contract them again for 5 seconds.</li> 

<li>Repeat the cycle of tightening and relaxation 5 times, for 3 or 4 times each day. </li>
</ul>		
	
<br><br>
<strong>Progression:</strong> Gradually increase the exercise to keep the muscles contracted for 10 seconds at a time, and relaxing for 10 seconds between contractions.
<br><br>
	
<strong>Note:</strong> Focus on tightening only your pelvic floor muscles. Be careful not to flex the muscles in your abdomen, thighs or buttocks. Avoid holding your breath and breathe freely during the exercises. Don't make a habit of using Kegel exercises to start and stop your urine stream.
