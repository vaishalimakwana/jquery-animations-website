	<div class="InnerHeading">When Eating out</div>

When at a restaurant, keep these simple tips in mind<br>
<ul class="bullets">	
<li>Try and eat a portion similar to what you would eat at home</li>
<li>Salad dressing- ask for it to be given on the side and add as per required. Choose mustard over mayonnaise. Choose Plain lime and vinegar dressing, low fat yoghurt</li>
<li>Ask for smaller or half portions</li>
<li>Skip the appetizers, bread and butter</li>
<li>Order extra veggies (eg. sauteed spinach, grilled mushrooms) on the side</li>
<li>Go for clear soups instead of creamy ones. Avoid fried croutons in the soup</li>
<li>Ask for less sauce to be put to your meals</li>
<li>You may ask the chef to hold the cream, which is often put as garnish over the dishes</li>
<li>You may ask the chef not to add any cream, tadka of ghee, butter before serving</li>
<li>Opt for any of the following healthier options-  roasted, steamed, grilled, broiled, poached, baked, lightly stir fried, red sauce(instead of white).</li>
<li>Preferably eat a plain roti/phulka/plain tandoori roti (without butter) and avoid bhatura, naan, kulcha and paratha.</li>
