	<li>During fevers, the hypothalamus functioning gets altered. Then hypothalamus to function normally needs an optimum amount of fluid in the body.</li>

<li>During the fever, The heat, the sweat and  the lack of fluid intake reduces water intake, which further alters the functioning of the hypothalamus.</li>

<li>When fevers go very high during the infection or fevers persist inspite of the infection coming under control, it is due to Hypothalamus malfunction.</li>

<li>The way to prevent this, is to drink at least 10 to 12 glasses fluids minimum during and at least a day or two after the fever settles.</li>


	</ul><br>
	<strong>Note : </strong>It's important to count the number of glasses because you might think you are drinking enough  but  actually drinking only lots of sips but not  enough quantity.

	<ul class="bullets">
<li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
Please use tepid water during sponging, that means Lukewarm water during winters or normal tap water during summers to sponge.
Do not use Eau De Cologne, cold and ice water at all. This causes the temperature to go higher.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2</strong><br> 
	Soak the towels in the water and squeeze out the excess water.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>
					Then use these to wrap various parts of the body, like hands, feet, forehead and stomach.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>
					Keep them wrapped for couple of minutes, then remove them and re soak them.</li> 

<li><strong>Step 5</strong><br>
				Repeat like this for at least 20 min till the body temperature starts coming down.</li>
