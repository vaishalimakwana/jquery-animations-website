						Diet is the specific intake of nutrition for health and weight management.
Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in maintaining the quality of life, health &amp; longevity.<br><br>

				Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars &amp; saturated and industrially produced trans fats are all the prerequisites to a healthy diet.
Hence,<br><br>
		
		<ol class="bullets">
		<li>Reduce salt intake, replace salt in salad with green(coriander/mint) chutney, parsley, herbs, black pepper, lemon, green chillies.</li>
		<li>Replace white sugar with jaggery or honey.</li>	
		</ol><br>				
	A meal is balanced when vegetables (vitamins), proteins and healthy carbohydrates are present.	<br><br>				
	3 different forms of proteins should be taken through the day to ensure that all essential amino acids are included in the diet.
These include:<br><br>
		<ol class="bullets">
		<li>Dairy products such as yogurt, paneer and cheese.</li>
		<li>Pulses like channa, chawli, rajma and various other sprouts.</li>
		<li>Non - Vegetarian food like egg whites, chicken, fish etc.</li>	
		</ol><br>			
						
		Studies have shown that diet high in protein and low carb (low glycemic index) aids weight loss, reduces blood sugar levels and lowers the risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.<br><br>
For example:<br>
Rice, wheat have higher calories and higher glycemic index.<br>
Jowar and bajra have high calorie and carb but low glycemic index.<br>
Quinoa, amaranth (rajgira) and buckwheat (kuttu) is lower in carbs, lower in glycemic index and high in proteins. <br><br>

Besides food, hydration plays an important role in maintaining a good diet plan. Body fluid levels  accounts for 60% of the body make up, hence has a vital impact on various health conditions like:<br><br>
Migraine, Hypertension, Hormonal Imbalances, Fevers, Urinary Infections,Lifestyle Disorders (Obesity) Skin etc. <br>
To maintain this body fluid level one should drink at least 2-2.5 Litres of fluids per day. <br><br>

Diet requires fine tuning, hence one should opt for healthier options like organic fruits &amp; vegetables, gluten free products, veganism, organic milk and healthier beverage options.<br><br>
